        Many people don’t like the idea of a ‘hike’. Immediately they associate the word with being slumped under a heavy pack, plodding up a slope in bulky, blister-causing boots with nothing to look forward to except warm water from a smelly bottle.

        Forget that, here’s a cool selection of walks and trails to suit all levels of fitness and experience - go get out there.

        ROYAL NATAL NATIONAL PARK, KWAZULU-NATAL
        Many of the Drakensberg’s finest treasures are accessible only to those who know how to cook on a small propane stove and live on instant noodles for days. Fortunately, there are many places in the dragon’s lair you can enjoy without becoming a full-on mountain goat.

        For the best day hikes, base yourself near the Royal Natal National Park in the northern Drakensberg. Most trails are well mapped and clearly marked and range from hour-long strolls to McKinley’s Pool and the Cascades, to more strenuous treks to the Mahai Falls. Stay for a few days and ease into the mountain rhythms with these shorter walks, then graduate to the Thukela Gorge. It’s a 14-kilometre round trip through mountain forest and protea grassland that will take you from Tendele Camp along the Thukela River and deep into the fold of the imposing Amphitheatre (but not to the top).

        HOERIKWAGGO TRAILS, WESTERN CAPE
        Table Mountain – of course you could simply hike up (via the popular Platteklip Gorge route) and ride the Cable Car down, but really, that’s for the tourists. The only way to really get in touch with, and understand the true significance of our most iconic natural symbol, is to overnight on it. The Hoerikwaggo Trail (the original Khoisan term for the mountain, meaning “Mountain in the Sea”) is a 75-kilometre traverse that will take five days.

        Because that’s beyond the skill (and time) level of most, it’s been broken into shorter, more manageable sections. We recommend the Silvermine Trail. From the Slangkop Lighthouse in Kommetjie, it’ll take you across the sands and vleis of Noordhoek and up Chapman’s Peak to Silvermine, where you’ll spend the night in a secluded tented camp. Swim in the dam instead of showering. The next day, traverse Constantiaberg to Constantia Nek and the end of the trail.</p></div>
